# Ruin

A ClojureScript roguelike library built on top of [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/).

`/src/demo` uses `ruin` to implement (most of) [Dominic Charley-Roy](https://github.com/jokeofweek)'s [roguelike tutorial](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/).

## Disclaimer

`ruin` is far from complete and could use a lot of work; it's certainly not fit for public use. That said, it does serve as a demonstration of how one might go about building a roguelike in ClojureScript.
